# GeoM-v1
Snap of magnetic measuremenst for the smart city project

Data set presents an initial study for monitoring the magnetic field in real time for the field of smart cities, using a mobile phone. In total six sets of measurements have been made; two at static locations (S), two by walking (W) and two by car driving (C), with both rural and urban settings considered for each scenario. In total 28 measurements have been made. For the measurements iPhone 13 was used, using application CrowdMag (ver 2.1.3) The measurement by took place in a time interval of 10 seconds. 

By this data set, we addressed the challenge of measuring geomagnetic fields, which are highly dynamic in nature, making this a timely and relevant research topic.
